## Motivation:
Misinformation during the 2020 election eventually led to the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol. As the influence of social media increases, so does the ability of social media to spread false narratives and cause harm. Especially due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, different narratives of misinformation have led to further distrust in the US government. By analyzing the dataset from https://esoc.princeton.edu/publications/esoc-covid-19-misinformation-dataset, we can determine causes and pathways of misinformation regarding COVID-19 in order to inform the general public and prevent these narratives from spreading further.

## Data:
For this project, I will be utilizing data from the princeton ESOC COVID-19 Misinformation Dataset from 2020. This dataset is applicable for this project because it uses recent data from 2020 in order to analyze different pathways of misinformation regarding COVID-19. This dataset records stories on misinformation efforts on social media and news outlets with sources, keywords, and direct links. A description of the coding methodology is found in the code book. This dataset is available at https://esoc.princeton.edu/publications/esoc-covid-19-misinformation-dataset. While I originally was deciding between two datasets, peer feedback allowed me to choose this dataset as it was more relevant to my interests and previous work. 

## Research questions:
What disinformation narratives around COVID-19 were spread the most in 2020?
What social media website had the most disinformation narratives around COVID-19  spreading in 2020?
What motives surrounded the most popular narratives around COVID-19?
How did individual actors contribute to bottom-up narratives around COVID-19?

## Unknowns: 
This dataset is published with an open license and therefore is free to use. It relates to COVID misinformation during 2020. Some ethical considerations around using this dataset could be around misunderstandings or changes to the data as this is still an open project for ESOC.

## Background
The election integrity partnership (which includes the Center for Informed Public at the University of Washington) released a report detailing how misinformation around the 2020 election spread. This included narratives around COVID-19 and how it complicated the political situation during the election. It also introduces what misinformation and disinformation are, and general ways in which they are spread. Misinformation is an umbrella term describing the spread of false, misleading or exaggerated information or claims. Disinformation is a subset of misinformation which describes the purposeful spread of misinformation with the intent to manipulate a specific narrative. More can be read at https://purl.stanford.edu/tr171zs0069. 

A UWM report covers how researchers "found a direct correlation between locations where Twitter misinformation originated and subsequent spikes in COVID-19 infections and deaths in those areas weeks later." They also found that there were seven dominating myths around COVID-19 which was propogated in misinformed tweets in 2020. These myths centered: 
1. Covid is over
2. Economic liberty over safety
3. Fake cures
4. Flu comparison/ not serious
5. Religious 
6. Ridiculing experts/ containment
7. Individual liberty over safety

Knowing these popular narratives informed my research questions as I wanted to know if data from a different source would show similar narratives. More information can be found here: https://uwm.edu/news/mapping-the-harm-of-covid-19-misinformation-on-social-media/

## Methodology 
To investigate my research questions, I will filter the dataset by Recoded_Main_Narrative and determine the top 10 narratives. I will then compare that with the social media platform was most popular for each narrative and the percentage each social media platform takes up for each narrative. I will then create a dataa visualization to show how the number of entries for each narratives compare. I will potentially create a stacked bar chart with what percentage of each popular narrative came from which social media platform. Otherwise, it will be two graphs. 
By determining the top narratives, I can compare this information with the information available from my background research. Including these in the form of a data visualization like a bar graph could be useful as it would show the scale for each narrative. 
Finally, I will generally mess around with the data and see if any interesting patterns emerge.
